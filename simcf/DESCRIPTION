Description:  Calculate counterfactual expected values and first
              differences for a variety of statistical models
              (e.g., logit, probit, multinomial logit), along with
              confidence intervals.  Useful for producing inputs to tile
              graphics such as ropeladder and lineplot.  (See Zelig
              for different and extensive facilities along these lines.)
              Also includes numerous utility functions.
